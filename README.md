# Skill demo
This is a demo for moba-like skills using Godot 3.1

Scenes will change throughout commits for testing. GDScript files are the most important here.

The code will be kept as general as possible, but the library is built for a specific gamestyle in mind.


There are no compiled binaries available. It must run with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
